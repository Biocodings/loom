Currently in pre-alpha prototyping. 
With xppfserver running, point a browser to: http://hostname:port/editor

### Current features:

### Future work:
* Transition inputs and outputs when new ones are added
* Resize step rects when too many inputs or outputs are added
* Sugiyama automatic layout
* Undo
* User accounts and server-side saved workflows
* Import JSON to workflow
* Visualization of currently running workflows
